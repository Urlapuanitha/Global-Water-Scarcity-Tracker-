#Project Title: Global Water Scarcity Tracker
#Description:
The Global Water Scarcity Tracker is an interactive data dashboard designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize the state of water availability and scarcity across different regions of the world. This tool empowers users—policy makers, researchers, students, and the general public—to explore the global water crisis through real-time and historical data insights.

The dashboard presents key indicators such as water stress levels, renewable water resources per capita, population growth, climate impact, and usage by sectors (agriculture, industry, domestic). Through dynamic visualizations like heat maps, bar graphs, and time series charts, users can compare regions and identify trends or hotspots of severe water scarcity.

This project aims to:

Raise awareness about global water scarcity.

Support data-driven decisions in water conservation and resource planning.

Encourage sustainable water use practices by making information accessible and engaging.

#Key Features:
Interactive world map with country-wise water scarcity levels.

Filters to compare water demand vs availability over time.

Sector-wise water usage visualization.

Climate influence on water resources.

Downloadable reports and insights for decision-making.

#Tech Stack:
Frontend: Streamlit / Dash / React (depending on your implementation)

Backend: Python (Pandas, Plotly, etc.)

Data Sources: FAO AQUASTAT, UN Water, World Bank datasets

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud / GitHub Pages / Heroku

#Impact:
By simplifying access to complex water-related datasets, this tracker contributes toward SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and fosters global water literacy.
